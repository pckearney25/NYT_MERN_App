# NYT_MERN_App

## Overview

A full-stack MERN application that incorporates A MongoDB, Express, Node, and React. The app is written such that it can be deployed on a local server or another remote server. In this application, the user enters a search topic, and defines starting and ending dates for the search. A successful search will return a maximum of ten results, which are then displayed. For each article, the user will see the title, a brief snippet, the URL, and the publication date. Upon clicking the URL, the article will open in a new window. The user also has the option of saving the article - and the article's information will be stored in the MongoDB. Upon saving, the article is removed from the search results and will be displayed in the saved articles area of the page.
